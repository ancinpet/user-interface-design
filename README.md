# Mockup for mobile app
Mockup for mobile app to practice user interface design, written in Angular with my colleagues.

This is just mockup, we could have used a software for mockups but since we wanted very detailed workflows, it was faster to just write a quick Angular FE without BE.

There is quite a lot of functionality on the mockup FE. It is using Material Design.
